# Marquee.js is now Svider.js!

I've completed rewritten Marquee.js to be more flexible, faster, and better align with well-formed jQuery plugin architecture.  I'll keep this here for your reference, but otherwise you should use Svider.js.  It's backwards compatible!

# Marquee.js

A jQuery Plugin by Scott Munn

Marquee.js is a jQuery plugin used to build tabs, carousels, and other layout switchers.  It supports transitioning between elements, onhashchange, navigation buttons including next, previous, first, last, and random, as well as touch-based or mouse-click swipe gestures.

## Usage

Include the necessary files: jQuery, and Marquee.js. (Please use the latest version of jQuery.)

`<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js"></script>`

`<script type="text/javascript" src="Marquee.js"></script>`

See index.html for sample code and usage instructions.
